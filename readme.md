# Part 1 (take home)

Get the list of comics from marvel.com using their REST API.

Display the list on the screen. Show the thumbnail and the name of the comic.

Allow user to select a comic from the list and display a detail view with additional information (use your discretion here to display more relevant information).

## Nice to have:

Cached data.

Create the test cases that you consider necessary to test that your application works.

 

# Part 2 (live pairing)

Let users search for comics by their name and year of production.

If there is time left over we can work on some other small features/improvements.

This will give insights to the following:

Ability to interpret basic product/feature requirements

Ability to interface with a 3rd party API

Basic app architecture

Use of 3rd part frameworks where appropriate

Code structure and readability

Separation of concerns

Testability

Async operations

Sense of product, functional UI and UX

 

## In the pairing we will:

Make sure you can justify and explain your decisions so far to a peer

Check you can introduce new functionality to an existing codebase

Sanity check that your existing work matches your ‘live’ work
